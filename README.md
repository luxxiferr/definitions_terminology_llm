# Unambiguous Definition Generation in Semantically Scarce Terminological Resources

High-quality terminological resources are essential for ensuring semantic precision and interoperability in specialised NLP applications. However, many existing terminological databases â€” such as the InterActive Terminology for Europe (IATE).  

This study explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate accurate, domain-appropriate definitions for specialised terms by leveraging contextual cues extracted from existing terminological resources. Two open-source models, **Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct** and **Mistral-7B-v0.1**, were evaluated across four experimental setups with progressively richer semantic context:  
1. **Zero-shot prompting** with term and domain labels.  
2. **Prompting with semantic information**, based on the addition of structured metadata.
3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with semantic information** for relational contextualization. 
4. **Scrapping** from external documents for context retrieval.

Results show that structured semantic metadata improves generation quality, while excessive or noisy contextual input can produce worse performance. For this task, **Llama-3.1** consistently outperformed **Mistral-7B**.
